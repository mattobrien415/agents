    "Let' see this working in practice by importing the email assistant with HITL from our module, `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py`. We'll compile the graph with a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#short-term-memory), which allows us to persist the state of the graph after interruption. We can then resume execution from the same state after the human has responded.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** here we change to the parent directory (`%cd ..`) to access our project's module structure, which contains reusable prompts and components. The autoreload extensions ensure any changes to these modules are automatically reflected in the notebook without requiring kernel restarts. This allows us to organize our prompts in a dedicated module rather than defining them inline, making them easier to maintain and reuse across the notebooks! You can see all these files in: `src/email_assistant`"

    "   - The user accepts the new draft\n",

    "   - The workflow proceeds with the user's input integrated\n",

    "## Test Case for Notify Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This test demonstrates how the system handles emails classified as \"NOTIFY\" and how users can respond to notifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The triage system classifies important informational emails as \"NOTIFY\" when:\n",
    "   - They contain important information (like security updates)\n",
    "   - They don't require immediate action\n",
    "   - They should be brought to the user's attention\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. For notify classifications:\n",
    "   - The workflow routes to the `triage_interrupt_handler`\n",
    "   - The user sees the email content with options to ignore or respond\n",
    "   - No default action is suggested\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In this test, we:\n",
    "   - Process an IT security update email that gets classified as \"NOTIFY\"\n",
    "   - Simulate the user deciding to respond with specific feedback\n",
    "   - See how the agent drafts an appropriate response based on this feedback\n",
    "   - Approve the response to be sent\n",
    "\n",
    "This showcases how the HITL system can transform a passive notification into an active response when the user decides one is warranted, bridging the gap between the initial \"NOTIFY\" classification and a full response."
