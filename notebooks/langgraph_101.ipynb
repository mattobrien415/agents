    "Agents are well suited to open-ended problems where it's difficult to predict the *exact* steps needed in advance.\n",

    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/) provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath *any* workflow or agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control**: Make it easy to define and / or combine agents and workflows.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Provide a way to persist the state of a graph, which enables both memory and human-in-the-loop.\n",
    "- **Testing, Debugging, and Deployment**: Provide an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph lets you define your application as a graph with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *State*: What information do we need to track over the course of the application?\n",
    "2. *Nodes*: How do we want to update this information over the course of the application?\n",
    "3. *Edges*: How do we want to connect these nodes together?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [`StateGraph` class](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#graphs) to initialize a LangGraph graph with a [`State` object](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state).\n",

    "`State` defines the schema for information we want to track over the course of the application. \n",
