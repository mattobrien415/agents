    "# Evaluating our Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "We've written an agentic workflow that uses a router to triage the email and then passes the email to the agent for response generation. How can we be sure that it will work well in production? This is why testing is important: it guides our decisions about our agent architecture with quantifiable metrics like response quality, token usage, latency, or triage accuracy. [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) offers two primary ways to test agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "![overview-img](img/overview_eval.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Approaches \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is well known to many developers as a powerful tool for writing tests within the Python ecosystem. LangSmith integrates with pytest to allow you to write tests that we can run on each assistant and log the results to LangSmith. Pytest is a great way to get started quickly with a framework you're already familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith Datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a dataset [in LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) and run each assistant against the dataset using the LangSmith evaluate API. LangSmith datasets are great for teams who are collaboratively building out their test suite. You can leverage production traces, annotation queues, and more, to add examples to an ever-growing golden dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing often starts with defining the test cases, which can be a challenging process. In this case, we'll just define a set of example emails we want to handle along with a few things to test. You can see the test cases in `eval/email_dataset.py`, which contains the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Emails**: A collection of diverse email examples\n",
    "2. **Ground Truth Classifications**: `Respond`, `Notify`, `Ignore`\n",
    "3. **Expected Tool Calls**: Tools called for each email that requires a response\n",
    "4. **Response Criteria**: What makes a good response for emails requiring replies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pytest Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of testing using Pytest. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will test whether our `email_assistant` makes the right tool calls when responding to the emails."

First, to [run with Pytest and log test results to LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest), we only need to add the `@pytest.mark.langsmith ` decorator to our function and place it in a file, as you see in `notebooks/test_tools.py`. Second, we can pass dataset examples to the test function as shown [here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest#parametrize-with-pytestmarkparametrize) via `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
