LangSmith integrates with these frameworks to allow you to write and run tests that log results to LangSmith. For this notebook, we'll use Pytest.\n",

    "* You can leverage production traces, annotation queues, synthetic data generation, and more, to add examples to an ever-growing golden dataset.\n",
