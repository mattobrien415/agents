    "# Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We've tested two different email assistant, both of which can triage emails and use tools to respond to them. But do we actually *trust* them to manage our inbox? Few would trust an AI to manage their inbox without some human oversight immediately, which is why human-in-the-loop (HITL) is a critical pattern for many agent systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "The HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) pattern is useful for applications where decisions require human validation. LangGraph provides built-in support for this through its [interrupt mechanism](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/interrupts/), allowing us to pause execution of an agent and request human input when needed. Let's add HITL to our email assistant after specific tools are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Interrupt Example\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's just show a simple example for how to use the `interrupt` function. Assume we want a simple agent that can ask the user a question and then use that information. The `interrupt` function can be used for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "location = interrupt(ask.question)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When this line executes:\n",
    "1. It raises a `GraphInterrupt` exception, which pauses the graph execution\n",
    "2. It surfaces the value passed in (`ask.question`) to the client TODO: explain the client\n",
    "3. Execution stops at this point until resumed \n",
    "4. When resumed, the function returns the value provided by the human\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a minimal example of how to implement this using `interrupt`:"

    "## Agent Inbox\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can implement basic human-in-the-loop functionality using `interrupt` calls and `Command` responses with the SDK, as shown above, this doesn't really scale well if we want to process a large number of emails and a variety of different actions. Our email assistant requires several types of human-in-the-loop interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Email Triage Review**:\n",
    "   - When an email is classified as \"NOTIFY,\" humans should verify this classification\n",
    "   - Users should be able to accept the classification or provide feedback on how it should be classified\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Email Response Review**:\n",
    "   - Before sending responses to important emails, humans should review the content\n",
    "   - Users need options to edit the draft, accept it as-is, provide feedback, or reject it entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meeting Scheduling Review**:\n",
    "   - When the assistant proposes scheduling a meeting, humans should verify the details\n",
    "   - Users should be able to modify attendees, duration, date/time before accepting\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any significant action (sending emails, scheduling meetings) requires human approval. Some low-risk tools (like calendar availability checks) can run without interruption. Of course, this is entirely dependent on the application and the risk of the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Inbox: A Purpose-Built HITL Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we built a simple interface for human-in-the-loop called [Agent Inbox](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox) that allows us to review and approve or reject actions taken by LangGraph agents. Agent Inbox provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Interaction Types**:\n",
    "   - `accept`: Approve the agent's action and continue\n",
    "   - `edit`: Modify the agent's proposed action before execution\n",
    "   - `response`: Provide feedback or answers without editing\n",
    "   - `ignore`: Reject the agent's action entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rich Content Display**:\n",
    "   - Render (email) content in a readable format\n",
    "   - Support markdown for structured information presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistent User Experience**:\n",
    "   - Notification system for pending reviews\n",
    "   - Action buttons that match the allowed interaction types\n",
    "   - Thread-based organization of agent activities\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Easy Integration with LangGraph**:\n",
    "   - Simple connection to local or hosted LangGraph deployments\n",
    "   - Compatible with LangGraph's interrupt mechanism\n",
    "   - No complex frontend development required\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with LangGraph's interrupt() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Inbox integrates seamlessly with LangGraph's `interrupt()` function. The integration works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Structure**: We structure an interrupt request with specific fields:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   request = {\n",
    "       \"action_request\": {\n",
    "           \"action\": \"write_email\",  # Name of the tool to call\n",
    "           \"args\": {\"to\": \"john@example.com\", \"subject\": \"Meeting\", \"content\": \"...\"}  # Action parameters\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       \"config\": {\n",
    "           \"allow_ignore\": True,   # Can dismiss the action\n",
    "           \"allow_respond\": True,  # Can provide feedback\n",
    "           \"allow_edit\": True,     # Can modify the action\n",
    "           \"allow_accept\": True,   # Can approve the action\n",
    "       },\n",
    "       \"description\": \"Email content to display...\" # Context shown to the user\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Passing to interrupt()**: We pass this request to the interrupt function:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = interrupt([request])[0]  # Can batch multiple requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Interaction**: Agent Inbox shows the request and collects the user's response\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Responses**: When execution resumes, we receive a structured `response`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if response[\"type\"] == \"accept\":\n",
    "       # Execute the tool with original args\n",
    "   elif response[\"type\"] == \"edit\":\n",
    "       # Execute with edited args from response[\"args\"]\n",
    "   elif response[\"type\"] == \"ignore\":\n",
    "       # Skip execution\n",
    "   elif response[\"type\"] == \"response\":\n",
    "       # Process feedback from response[\"args\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach allows our email assistant to collect precise human input at critical decision points while maintaining a consistent user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Email Assistant with Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand both the interrupt mechanism and Agent Inbox, let's look at our email assistant implementation with human-in-the-loop. This implementation brings together all the concepts we've discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It uses the `interrupt` function to pause execution at key decision points\n",
    "2. It structures interrupt requests specifically for Agent Inbox\n",
    "3. It processes different response types from human reviewers\n",
    "4. It integrates these HITL capabilities into a full email processing workflow"

    "   - **RESPOND**: Emails that require a response from the assistant.\n",

    "   - **IGNORE**: Low-priority emails that can be safely ignored.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The router uses a structured output LLM to make this classification and then routes to the appropriate next node based on its decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **triage_interrupt_handler**: When an email is classified as \"notify,\" this handler creates an interrupt to display the email in Agent Inbox and collect human feedback. This allows users to:\n",
    "   - Confirm the notification classification\n",
    "   - Provide feedback on how they would prefer similar emails to be classified in the future\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This feedback loop is crucial for improving the assistant's classification over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **llm_call**: This node invokes the LLM with the available tools to decide how to respond to an email. The LLM might decide to:\n",

    "   - Ask the user a question\n",

    "### The interrupt_handler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `interrupt_handler` is the core HITL component of our response agent. Its job is to examine the tool calls that the LLM wants to make and determine which ones need human review before execution. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Selection**: The handler maintains a list of \"HITL tools\" that require human approval:\n",
    "   - `write_email`: Since sending emails has significant external impact\n",
    "   - `schedule_meeting`: Since scheduling meetings affects calendars\n",
    "   - `Question`: Since asking users questions requires direct interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Execution**: Tools not in the HITL list (like `check_calendar_availability`) are executed immediately without interruption. This allows low-risk operations to proceed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Preparation**: For tools requiring review, the handler:\n",
    "   - Retrieves the original email for context\n",
    "   - Formats the tool call details for clear display\n",
    "   - Configures which interaction types are allowed for each tool type\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interrupt Creation**: The handler creates a structured interrupt request with:\n",
    "   - The action name and arguments\n",
    "   - Configuration for allowed interaction types\n",
    "   - A description that includes both the original email and the proposed action\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Processing**: After the interrupt, the handler processes the human response:\n",
    "   - **Accept**: Executes the tool with original arguments\n",
    "   - **Edit**: Updates the tool call with edited arguments and then executes\n",
    "   - **Ignore**: Cancels the tool execution\n",
    "   - **Response**: Records feedback without execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler ensures humans have oversight of all significant actions while allowing routine operations to proceed automatically. The ability to edit tool arguments (like email content or meeting details) gives users precise control over the assistant's actions."

    "1. **Response Agent Subgraph**:\n",
    "   First, we build a standalone agent that can handle email responses:\n",
    "   - The `llm_call` node generates responses or tool calls\n",
    "   - The `should_continue` function checks if the agent is done or needs to use a tool\n",
    "   - The `interrupt_handler` manages human review of tool execution\n",
    "   - The cycle continues until the agent reaches a conclusion\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This response agent is compiled as a reusable subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overall Email Assistant Workflow**:\n",
    "   Then, we create the main workflow that:\n",
    "   - Starts with `triage_router` to classify the email\n",
    "   - Routes to `triage_interrupt_handler` for NOTIFY classifications\n",
    "   - Routes to `response_agent` for RESPOND classifications\n",
    "   - Ends immediately for IGNORE classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture provides a clean separation of concerns, with distinct components for triage, response generation, and human oversight. The resulting workflow gives us a complete email assistant that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzes incoming emails\n",
    "- Correctly routes them based on importance\n",
    "- Engages humans for oversight at critical decision points\n",
    "- Responds appropriately to important emails\n",
