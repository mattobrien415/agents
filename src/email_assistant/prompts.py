< Instructions >

{name} gets lots of emails. Your job is to categorize each email into one of three categories:

1. IGNORE - Emails that are not worth responding to or tracking
2. NOTIFY - Important information that {name} should know about but doesn't require a response
3. RESPOND - Emails that need a direct response from {name}

Classify the below email into one of these categories.

</ Instructions >

< Rules >
Emails that are not worth responding to:
{triage_no}

There are also other things that {name} should know about, but don't require an email response. For these, you should notify {name} (using the `notify` response). Examples of this include:
{triage_notify}

Emails that are worth responding to:
{triage_email}
